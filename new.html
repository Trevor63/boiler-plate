    <p><strong>Hello there! </strong>My name is Okumu Yaite and I am proud to be a noobie programmer.</p>
    <p>Here's to great learning.</p>
    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <!-- this is a comment
    that makesthe browser ignore the text between these brackts?-->
    <p>I graduated in the year 2022 from the Technical University of Mombasa with a <em>Diploma in ICT</em>. Ever since a young age, I have been very curious as to how electronics, specifically computers work; how the hardware communicates with the software.</p>
    <p>Ever since completing college, i have over <em>2 years of experience </em>in an IT support role in the County Government of Busia. I have belief that i have mastered the hardware components and now plan and put the work to venture into software. Where else to begin other than the World Wide Web.</p>
